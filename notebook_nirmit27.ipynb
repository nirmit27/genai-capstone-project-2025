DJT”.Less than four hours later, he shocked investors by announcing a 90-day pause on additional trade tariffs on most countries except China, sending share indexes soaring.In America the S&P 500 blue chip index closed up by more than 9%, while the technology-focused Nasdaq index shut more than 12% up. Stocks continued to rise in Asia and Europe on Thursday, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 index up by 9%, and London’s FTSE 100 index rising by as much as 4% in early trading.Trump does not usually sign off his post with his initials. Those letters happen to be the same as the ticker for Trump Media & Technology Group, the business that controls Truth Social, whose stock shot up by 22% on Wednesday.The timing of the US president’s posts and subsequent huge share jumps has sparked accusations of market manipulation. The Democratic senator Adam Schiff has called for an investigation, saying: “These constant gyrations in policy provide dangerous opportunities for insider trading.“Who in the administration knew about Trump’s latest tariff flip-flop ahead of time? Did anyone buy or sell stocks, and profit at the public’s expense? I’m writing to the White House – the public has a right to know.”The Democratic senator Chris Murphy also wrote on X that an “insider trading scandal is brewing … Trump’s 9:30am tweet makes it clear he was eager for his people to make money off the private info only he knew. So who knew ahead of time and how much money did they make?”The New York Democratic representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called for all members of Congress to disclose any stocks they had bought in the past 24 hours. “I’ve been hearing some interesting chatter on the floor,” she wrote on X. “Disclosure deadline is May 15th. We’re about to learn a few things. It’s time to ban insider trading in Congress.”When asked by US reporters on Wednesday evening when exactly he arrived at his decision to pause the tariffs on most countries for 90 days, Trump said: “For a period of a time. I would say this morning. Over the last few days, I’ve been thinking about it.”However White House officials have argued the shift was part of the strategy all along, with his press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, arguing it was his “art of the deal” at work.Several investors have used volatility in the stock market in recent weeks as a buying opportunity. The US representative for Georgia, Republican and Trump ally Marjorie Taylor Greene, disclosed that she had made several purchases on 3 and 4 April – days when there were sharp market falls after Trump first detailed his “liberation day” tariffs on 2 April – including shares in Amazon.com and Apple. Shares in the technology companies rose by 12% and 15% respectively on Wednesday.While Trump has paused many of the new country-specific tariffs, he has maintained pressure on China, the second biggest economy in the world. He increased the tariff on Chinese imports to 125% from the 104% level that started on Wednesday. Beijing could respond again after hitting US imports with 84% tariffs that began on Thursday.\"\"\"\n\nMarkdown(summarize_article(news_article))","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-12T02:48:24.67573Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-12T02:48:24.67619Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-12T02:48:25.894897Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-12T02:48:24.676144Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-12T02:48:25.893775Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Step 2: Video understanding\nThe following code snippets demonstrate the summarization of a YouTube video using the **Gemini Pro** model.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Downloading the video\nDownloading a sample video from YouTube in the `.mp4` format","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"url = r\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8NEJAsha-s\"\n \nyt = YouTube(url, on_progress_callback = on_progress)\nprint(yt.title)\n \nys = yt.streams.get_highest_resolution()\nys.download()","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-12T02:48:34.001325Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-12T02:48:34.001726Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-12T02:48:34.295358Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-12T02:48:34.001696Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-12T02:48:34.294391Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"video_filepath = None\n\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk(os.getcwd()):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        if filename.endswith('.mp4'):\n            video_filepath = os.path.join(dirname, filename)\n\nvideo_filepath","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-12T02:48:36.63946Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-12T02:48:36.639908Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-12T02:48:36.648751Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-12T02:48:36.639869Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-12T02:48:36.647436Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Video summarization\nPrompting the **Gemini Pro** model to summarize the video.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"Uploading to the File API...\")\nvideo_file = client.files.upload(file=video_filepath)\nprint(\"Upload complete!\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-12T02:48:39.06909Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-12T02:48:39.069508Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-12T02:48:40.227784Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-12T02:48:39.069473Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-12T02:48:40.226243Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"while video_file.state.name == \"PROCESSING\":\n    print('Waiting for video to be processed...')\n    sleep(10)\n    video_file = client.files.get(name=video_file.name)\n\nif video_file.state.name == \"FAILED\":\n  raise ValueError(video_file.state.name)\n\nprint(f'Video processing complete: ' + video_file.uri)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-12T02:48:42.887345Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-12T02:48:42.887795Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-12T02:48:53.167435Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-12T02:48:42.887754Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-12T02:48:53.166238Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"prompt = \"\"\"I need you to create a comprehensive summary of this YouTube video transcript.

The quality and availability of the API's features directly impacts the chatbot's performance.\n- **Structured Output Constraint:** The response quality depends on the model's ability to adhere strictly to the specified output format. Any deviation from the defined format can impact downstream processing and the usability of the extracted information. (This assumes the model doesn't always perfectly follow the output structure.)\n\n### Future Scope\n- Improving the robustness and accuracy of the structured summary generation by experimenting with different models and prompt engineering techniques. Additionally, exploring more advanced caching strategies and integrating the system with other video platforms would enhance its scalability and versatility.\n- Integrating this chatbot with various communication platforms (e.g., Slack, Discord) and incorporating it into larger workflows for video content management and knowledge sharing. Furthermore, exploring techniques for automatically identifying and summarizing trending videos would enable proactive knowledge discovery and dissemination.\n\n<!-- Check out my [blogpost](#) for more details on this project! -->","metadata":{}}]}
