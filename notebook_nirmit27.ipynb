This project summarizes the latest news or YouTube videos on any topic by leveraging generative AI to provide concise, accurate digests of complex information. üì∞\n\n### Problem\nThe information overload in today's digital landscape presents significant challenges for individuals trying to stay informed. Users face difficulties in efficiently processing the overwhelming volume of news articles and video content available across multiple platforms. Traditional consumption methods are time-consuming and often result in missing key insights or context. **NewsGenius AI** addresses this challenge by providing an automated solution that extracts and synthesizes essential information from diverse media sources, enabling users to quickly grasp the core content without sacrificing comprehension.\n\n### Solution\nThis tool integrates multiple Gen AI capabilities to:\n- Efficiently summarize text content from news articles while preserving key information and context.\n- Extract and condense important insights from YouTube videos into a well-formatted summary.\n- Build a Q&A chatbot leveraging RAG to provide informed answers based on a video summary.\n\n### Gen AI Capabilities\n1. **Few-shot Prompting & Structured Output** : Summarization of a news article excerpt with few-shot prompting.\n2. **Video Understanding** : Summarization of a YouTube video using the Gemini Pro model.\n3. **Retrieval augmented generation (RAG)** : Building a Q&A chatbot leveraging RAG to provide informed answers based on a video summary.\n\n> *This notebook has been submitted for the Gen AI Intensive Course Capstone 2025Q1 Project, open April 4 -

DJT‚Äù.Less than four hours later, he shocked investors by announcing a 90-day pause on additional trade tariffs on most countries except China, sending share indexes soaring.In America the S&P 500 blue chip index closed up by more than 9%, while the technology-focused Nasdaq index shut more than 12% up. Stocks continued to rise in Asia and Europe on Thursday, with Japan‚Äôs Nikkei 225 index up by 9%, and London‚Äôs FTSE 100 index rising by as much as 4% in early trading.Trump does not usually sign off his post with his initials. Those letters happen to be the same as the ticker for Trump Media & Technology Group, the business that controls Truth Social, whose stock shot up by 22% on Wednesday.The timing of the US president‚Äôs posts and subsequent huge share jumps has sparked accusations of market manipulation. The Democratic senator Adam Schiff has called for an investigation, saying: ‚ÄúThese constant gyrations in policy provide dangerous opportunities for insider trading.‚ÄúWho in the administration knew about Trump‚Äôs latest tariff flip-flop ahead of time? Did anyone buy or sell stocks, and profit at the public‚Äôs expense? I‚Äôm writing to the White House ‚Äì the public has a right to know.‚ÄùThe Democratic senator Chris Murphy also wrote on X that an ‚Äúinsider trading scandal is brewing ‚Ä¶ Trump‚Äôs 9:30am tweet makes it clear he was eager for his people to make money off the private info only he knew. So who knew ahead of time and how much money did they make?‚ÄùThe New York Democratic representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called for all members of Congress to disclose any stocks they had bought in the past 24 hours. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been hearing some interesting chatter on the floor,‚Äù she wrote on X. ‚ÄúDisclosure deadline is May 15th. We‚Äôre about to learn a few things. It‚Äôs time to ban insider trading in Congress.‚ÄùWhen asked by US reporters on Wednesday evening when exactly he arrived at his decision to pause the tariffs on most countries for 90 days, Trump said: ‚ÄúFor a period of a time. I would say this morning. Over the last few days, I‚Äôve been thinking about it.‚ÄùHowever White House officials have argued the shift was part of the strategy all along, with his press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, arguing it was his ‚Äúart of the deal‚Äù at work.Several investors have used volatility in the stock market in recent weeks as a buying opportunity. The US representative for Georgia, Republican and Trump ally Marjorie Taylor Greene, disclosed that she had made several purchases on 3 and 4 April ‚Äì days when there were sharp market falls after Trump first detailed his ‚Äúliberation day‚Äù tariffs on 2 April ‚Äì including shares in Amazon.com and Apple. Shares in the technology companies rose by 12% and 15% respectively on Wednesday.While Trump has paused many of the new country-specific tariffs, he has maintained pressure on China, the second biggest economy in the world. He increased the tariff on Chinese imports to 125% from the 104% level that started on Wednesday. Beijing could respond again after hitting US imports with 84% tariffs that began on Thursday.\"\"\"\n\nMarkdown(summarize_article(news_article))","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-12T03:22:19.768373Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-12T03:22:19.768686Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-12T03:22:20.982951Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-12T03:22:19.768664Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-12T03:22:20.981922Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":9,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"## Article Summary\n\n**Key Points:**\n- Deere & Co.

The quality and availability of the API's features directly impacts the chatbot's performance.\n- **Structured Output Constraint:** The response quality depends on the model's ability to adhere strictly to the specified output format. Any deviation from the defined format can impact downstream processing and the usability of the extracted information. (This assumes the model doesn't always perfectly follow the output structure.)\n\n### Future Scope\n- Improving the robustness and accuracy of the structured summary generation by experimenting with different models and prompt engineering techniques. Additionally, exploring more advanced caching strategies and integrating the system with other video platforms would enhance its scalability and versatility.\n- Integrating this chatbot with various communication platforms (e.g., Slack, Discord) and incorporating it into larger workflows for video content management and knowledge sharing. Furthermore, exploring techniques for automatically identifying and summarizing trending videos would enable proactive knowledge discovery and dissemination.\n\n<!-- Check out my [blogpost](#) for more details on this project! -->","metadata":{}}]}
